a) good
b) good
c) you did not show the list of most informative variables and their weights -2
c) you did not plot the model's mean absolute error values on cross-validation relative to the percentage of selected features -2
c) you need to aim to get the lowest mae, not max -2
d) you need to aim to get the lowest cv mae score -2
d) you did not plot the error values on the training and cross-validation splits across the specified values of the alpha parameter -2

results_Q2: -13.0
Q2
a) you forgot to compute the distance -1
try:
def cos_sim(x, D):
    x_norm = np.linalg.norm(x)
    D_norm = np.linalg.norm(D)
    similarity = np.dot(x, D) / (x_norm * D_norm)
    dists = 1 - similarity
    return dists
b) good
c) your distance function might be causing the long processing time. also revisit your kmeans, refer to the in-class examples -2
d) good
e) none submitted -10
